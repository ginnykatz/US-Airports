# US Airports
**Project Name:** Airports in the United States

https://ginnykatz.github.io/us-airports/

**Introduction:** This map was created to display all of the airports in the United States and whether or not those airports have control towers. The colors chose are meant to evoke a clean airport sense of place. 

**Major Functions:** This map can assist pilots that wish to see what airports they are nearby to and which ones will have control towers that can communicate with their airplanes. A video of an airplane taking off was included for an extra eye-catching effect, and users of this web map can pause or play the video using the buttons on the right side of the screen.

**Data Sources:** The dataset containing the list of airports in the United States was obtained from USGS, here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile. The dataset containing the state boundaries of the United States was obtained from Mike Bostock of D3, here: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/

**Credits:** This map was created with Leaflet, data from USGS and D3, and CartoDB.

**Acknowledgements:** I'd like to thank professor Bo Zhao at Oregon State University for his web mapping expertise and guidance. I highly recommend his GEOG 371 Web Mapping course.
