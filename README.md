# US Airports
**Project Name:** Airports in the United States

<<<<<<< HEAD
An interactive map of locations of US airports and control towers. 

Oregon State University , Advanced Web Mapping GEOG 571

Data: USGS and [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike) of [D3](http://d3js.org/).

Base Map: "Airports" by GinnyKatz via Mapbox mapbox://styles/ginnykatz/cjgkk9y9h000m2rqdltjuhvgv  

Live link:  <https://ginnykatz.github.io/us-airports/>

**Introduction:** This map was created to display all of the airports in the United States and whether or not those airports have control towers. The colors chose are meant to evoke a clean airport sense of place.

**Major Functions:** This map can assist pilots that wish to see what airports they are nearby to and which ones will have control towers that can communicate with their airplanes. A video of an airplane taking off was included for an extra eye-catching effect, and users of this web map can pause or play the video using the buttons on the right side of the screen.

**Data Sources:** The dataset containing the list of airports in the United States was obtained from USGS, here: <https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile>. The dataset containing the state boundaries of the United States was obtained from Mike Bostock of D3, here: <https://bost.ocks.org/mike/>

**Credits:** This map was created with Leaflet, data from USGS and D3, and CartoDB.

**Acknowledgements:** Thank the GEOG 571 professor , Dr. Bo Zhao,  at Oregon State University.
